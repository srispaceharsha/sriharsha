	 		The other day I met Albert Camus. Strangely enough, this wasn't the first time. But when I first met, I hadn't noticed him. This time we met each other at the Aadhaar card enrolment office. While I was there to inquire about the process of procuring one for myself, Albert was there to update his fingerprints. He mentioned he couldn't authorize transactions with his fingerprints. Thus he couldn't avail his pension anymore. "Please update your biometric again; your finger has faded," the clerk at the bank had told him.

			There was a long queue at the center, and it was a hot summer day. Albert was right in front of me; thus, I ended up chatting with him. While most folks in the queue were getting restless and fidgety, Albert was quite content to stand there, his 5th attempt to update his fingers on the database, he mentioned. He mentioned he couldn't understand why folks lose their cool in these situations. Men are quite irrational, we quickly concluded.

			I told him that I had read The Stranger recently again and had to admit that I identified myself with the protagonist of the story a lot more than I liked. It made me a bit uncomfortable, I mentioned.Albert said quite a lot of people identify themselves with the protagonist, especially in their thirties and forties, and it is natural to sort of feel ashamed for it.Same people, if they read it again much later in life, would have no shame in completely identifying themselves as the protagonist, he had noticed."Many of us are strangers in our own way," I quickly commented, feeling quite proud of my witty remark. Albert didn't have much in the way of a response.

			While people still discuss his novels and ideas with him, he doesn't particularly like it. It made him a bit nauseous; he'd rather go fishing or try to chat up a young woman, he told me. But this particular problem of not getting his pension had currently occupied his world entirely, leaving little time or money for any leisure activities.

			I told him that I am a bit surprised that he has opted for getting Aadhaar, and is okay with all the privacy he has to give up for it. He seemed the least bit concerned about this topic. "I need my pension", he said.

			After a while, it was his turn to meet the officer in the center. I met another officer for a quick check of my documents at the same time. Later, while heading out of the Aadhaar enrollment center, I bumped into Albert again outside the office. He mentioned the computer had failed to update his fingerprints, and he would have to attempt again later this month.
