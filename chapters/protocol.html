  			A protocol:

			When I am receptive and open, I see each moment becoming another, a rhythm in the becoming itself. It is a movement, and a tango between me and the rhythm. The barrier of outside and inside becomes thin, permeable. I can breathe through the movement of the moments. 

			At any time, these moments carry rhythms, in many directions. A continuous flow of notes, one leading to another. If I try to catch any one rhythm specifically, others go unseen, unheard, unobserved. I just have to follow “Let it come, let it be, let it go”.

			Each song lingers around for a while. It is near impossible to capture the experience as it is, it becomes a personal translation, a poetic view with flavors added. I try to hold on to the memory of the song, but as the intensity fades, even that dissolves until only an essence remains.

			Like the ocean waves washing my feet with warm salty water, tickling me with the foam and the sand, this moment by moment rhythm of the experience touches my senses.  I cannot capture the waves themselves, I cannot hold on to the rhythm. When the waves recede, and I walk away from the shore, all that remains are specks of sand, a flavor of sea salt.

			A manual: 

			Be open, hear the wind sing.
			Catch the drift, stay still,
			breathe in, breathe out.
			Can you feel the rhythm?

			Notice the kites dancing
			to the tunes of the ocean,
			and the Sun smiling upon you!

			Many songs in each moment
			note by note, they pass by
			Catch one and you lose!

			May the rhythm, the notes
			the whole song fill you full
			Let the mood linger on and on...

			Let the ocean wash your feet,
			you can't catch the waves.
			But the ocean salt sticks on you.

			A poem:

			"Sea salt"

			Walking along the seashore,
			breathing in, breathing out,
			I felt a rhythm: a new one.

			I watched the kites dancing
			to the song of the ocean,
			and the Sun smiling upon me.

			Many tunes in each moment
			note by note, they pass by.
			Catch one, lose them all!

			I let the rhythm, the notes,
			the whole song fill me full.
			And the mood linger on and on...

			I dip my toes in the foamy ocean,
			I can't catch the waves anyway.
			But the sea salt sticks on me.
